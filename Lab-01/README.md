## Lab 01-1: Digital Literacy Audit & Workplace Digital Technology Mapping

---

## Lab Overview

This **Lab** introduces students to reflective and analytical thinking about **digital literacy** and **digital technologies used in the workplace**.  
Students will evaluate their own digital skills, map workplace technologies to business processes, and identify improvement opportunities that are relevant to real organisational contexts. This lab is **formative**, skills-focused, and designed to support students who may be entering diverse workplaces, placements, or part-time employment environments.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

- Identify and categorise digital tools used in their workplace (or placement) and explain the **business value** they support.
- Self-assess their **digital literacy** and define **three measurable learning goals** for the module.
- Communicate findings clearly using a **digital mapping worksheet** and a **short reflective write-up**.

---

## Prerequisites  
**Before beginning, ensure you have:**

- Access to the **Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)**  
- A laptop or lab computer with **spreadsheet and word processing software**
- Basic familiarity with workplace or organisational digital tools  
  (current job, placement, part-time work, or a known organisation)

If you are **not currently employed**, you may:
- Use a **previous workplace**, OR  
- Use a **case-based approximation** of an organisation you understand well (clearly label this in your submission).

# Part 1 (Individual – 25–35 minutes)  
## Digital Literacy Audit

### Step-by-Step Student Instructions

#### Step 1: Open the Audit Form (2 minutes)
- Log in to the **VLE**
- Open **“Week 1: Digital Literacy Audit”**

#### Step 2: Complete the Audit (10–12 minutes)
Answer honestly. The audit covers:

- **Digital Communication**  
  (email etiquette, Teams/Zoom, collaboration tools)
- **Data & Spreadsheets**  
  (sorting, pivot tables, charts, data quality basics)
- **Digital Security & Privacy**  
  (passwords, phishing awareness, GDPR basics)
- **Digital Business Tools**  
  (CRM/ERP, e-commerce, automation, analytics)
- **AI & Emerging Technology Awareness**  
  (ChatGPT use, limitations, risks, ethics)
- **Confidence Rating**  
  Scale of 1–5, plus short examples of tasks you can currently perform

#### Step 3: Auto-Score & Identify Gaps (3–5 minutes)
At the end of the form, you should see:
- Areas of strength
- Areas for improvement

If auto-scoring is not enabled, manually note:
- **Top 2 strengths**
- **Top 2 development areas**

#### Step 4: Set 3 SMART Learning Goals (8–10 minutes)
Write **three SMART goals** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

**Example SMART goal:**
> “By Week 4, I will create a pivot table and chart from a dataset and explain key insights in 150 words.”

**Goal prompts (choose any three):**
- Spreadsheet data analysis (pivot tables, charts, data cleaning)
- Cyber hygiene at work (password managers, phishing checks)
- Digital collaboration (Teams, SharePoint, Google Drive workflows)
- Process automation (forms + spreadsheets + simple workflows)
- Responsible use of AI tools (prompting, verification, citation)

**Deliverable from Part 1:**  
- Audit submitted  
- Three SMART goals drafted

# Part 2 (Individual – 30–40 minutes)  
## Workplace Digital Technology Mapping

### What You Will Produce
A completed **Workplace Technology Mapping Worksheet** identifying:
- Digital tools used at work
- Business functions they support
- Benefits, risks, and improvement opportunities

---

### Step-by-Step Student Instructions

#### Step 1: Download the Mapping Template (2 minutes)
- From the VLE: **“Workplace Technology Mapping Template”**

#### Step 2: Complete Your Workplace Context (5 minutes)
At the top of the spreadsheet, fill in:
- Workplace / Industry  
- Role / Department  
- Main business processes supported (choose 2–3):  
  Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR, Operations, Customer Service, Logistics, Admin, Compliance

#### Step 3: List at Least 10 Digital Tools (10–15 minutes)
Complete the table below.  
If workplace access is limited, use a **case-based approximation** and label it clearly.

**Template Table (copy into Excel / Calc):**

| Tool / System | Type (App / Platform / Device) | Business Function | Task Supported | Data Used | Users | Benefit (time / cost / quality) | Risk / Issue | Technology Pillar |
|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|-------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|

#### Simple “Nine Technology Pillars” (use one per tool)
- Cloud & Platforms  
- Data & Analytics  
- AI & Automation  
- Cybersecurity & Privacy  
- Connectivity / Networks  
- Digital Collaboration Tools  
- Customer Digital Channels (web, social, e-commerce)  
- Enterprise Systems (ERP / CRM / HR systems)  
- Emerging Technologies (IoT, blockchain, AR/VR)

---

#### Step 4: Create 3 Business Process Maps (10 minutes)
Below the table, create **three simple process flows**.

**Example (Customer Enquiry Process):**

Customer email → Shared inbox → CRM ticket created → Response template → Issue resolved → Weekly report

Choose any **three processes** relevant to your workplace.

#### Step 5: Identify 2 Improvements (5–8 minutes)
Write:
- **One quick-win improvement** (low cost / easy)
- **One strategic improvement** (larger change)

Each improvement must explain:
- What changes
- Why it helps (time, quality, customer experience, compliance)
- Risks or controls needed (security, training, data quality)

**Deliverable from Part 2:**  
- Completed mapping worksheet

# Part 3 (Paired Discussion – 10–15 minutes)  
## Share & Compare

### Step-by-Step
1. Pair up with the student next to you.
2. Each student shares:
   - One tool that adds the **most value**
   - One tool or process that causes the **most friction**
   - One **digital skill** they want to build this term
3. As a pair, agree on one shared insight:

> “The biggest digital challenge across our workplaces is ______ because ______.”

**Optional (2 minutes):**  
Post your shared insight to the class Padlet or shared document.

---

## What You Submit (End of Class)

1. **Workplace Technology Mapping file** (Excel / Calc)
2. **Short Reflection (150–250 words)** (Word / Writer)

### Reflection Prompts (answer all):
- What did you learn about how digital tools support workplace processes?
- What is your biggest digital skills gap right now?
- Which of your three goals matters most for your workplace performance, and why?
